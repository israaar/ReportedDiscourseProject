__THE LAST VERSION OF TEMPLATE__: SR-Template.etf
__you can add your language-specific tags in YOUR version of the template, don't modify the original one___

press Alt for selecting several annotations

- __rp__: prosodic units
- __qt__: syntactic unit, so ***order of elements doesnâ€™t matter***
- __typ__: semantic type of Discourse Report
- __par__: reference to interaction participant (e.g. reported listener or current speaker)

## Annotation step by step
1. segment sound file ***BASED ON PROSODY***
2. transcribe and translate
3. tokenize 
4. gloss
5. annotate for reported discourse (4 tiers, SR-Template.etf)


### Notes about *other* option:

- unclear songs (you don't know whether it is a reported discourse or no) -> other (__rp__ tier)
- if construction type is unusual -> other (__qt__ tier) 

### Notes about *interjections*:

- interjections are ***separate Discourse Report*** 

### Notes about long Discourse reports

- if you have a long quote (He said: "Where are you? I've been looking for you. You are nice etc."), we do not treat it as DR Event + Discourse Report, because there are *bare quotes* there (He said: "Where are you? *bare quotes* I've been looking for you. *bare quotes* You are nice etc."), so they are different construction units
