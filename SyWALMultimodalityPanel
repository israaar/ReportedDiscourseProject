At the fringes of grammar: multi-modal strategies in reported speech in West African languages. 

The prominence of multi-modal strategies, such as prosody, gesture, body movement and eye gaze are characteristic of speech reports 
across languages (REF see S&N 2019a). Whereas some scholars go as far as to support "a view in which reported speech is a ‘multi-modal’ 
phenomenon, which is not signalled through language structure per se, but is equally created through special gestures and voice quality 
(Blackwell et al. 2015; Dancygier & Sweetser 2012; Lampert 2013; Stec et al. 2015). "(Spronck and Niktina 2019a: 142), 
Spronck and Niktina (2019a) find it "improbable that multi-modal strategies can have the grammatical status of a marking element". 
This workshop aims at investigating the diversity of multimodal strategies attested in the languages of West-Africa, as well as 
multi-modal features they have in common. Special prominence will be given to the use of different strategies within a single language, 
as well as possible connections/correlations with morphosyntactic marking of reported speech.
Especially variability within languages is relevant to research on multi-modality because it may help resolve its unclear status 
at the fringes of grammar. In order to enable comparison, we encourage description of the multi-modal strategies characteristic of 
(and possibly used to mark) reported speech in West-African languages because any claim regarding their status as part (or not) 
of grammar lacks substance if it is not based on natural speech data. 
We expect the exchange between scholars working on spoken languages and scholars working on sign languages to boost the advance 
of multi-modality research, as the latter maybe ahead of the former regarding the question whether multimodal strategies such as gesture, 
eye gaze, etc. can form part of the grammar of a language or not.
